This research investigates contemporary climate change and non-native species (NNS) in marine brackish ecosystems. The focus is on extreme events such as warming and freshening (a sudden decline in salinity). 
Along coastlines, increased rainfall events may alter the dynamics of tidal and riverine ebb and flow oscillations. 
The repercussions of intense and prolonged declines in salinity may alter resource availability, species' competitive ability and overall ecological dominance within marine/brackish communities. 

We deployed settlement panels in two locations distinguished by different salinity regimes, one with stable salinity regimes and the other with greater salinity fluctuations. To detect salinity dynamics we deployed high-resolution salinity metres in the study sites. Other environmental factors were recorded and measured.

We found the community trajectory differed between locations, with greater variability in salinity leading to a more stable assemblage structure. Across all panels, solitary ascidians were the dominant taxon and covered the majority of the panels. However, in cases where they had reduced cover, NNS could achieve greater space occupancy. While solitary ascidians persisted in spite of exposure to high salinity variability, reduced temperatures and increased rainfall, modelling indicated that freshening and warming facilitated NNS over natives. Therefore, weather events may lead to increased opportunities for NNS to proliferate. Future studies investigating climate change should explore decreasing salinity to increase our understanding of its influence within the epibenthic communities.
